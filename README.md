# Cirrhosis Metabolism

Reproducibility of all analyses is ensured by the R package [workflowr](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr) by deploying all analysis 
scripts at a dedicated [website](https://christianholland.github.io/cirrhosis-metabolism).

## About
In this project the expression of genes involved in the metabolism of 
xenobiotic substances is analyzed in a mouse model that develops chronic liver 
disease induced by administration of CCl~4~ for 2, 6 and 12 months. In addition 
their expression in mouse is compared against the expression in patients that 
suffer from chronic liver disease utilizing a set of publicly available patient 
cohorts (see Table 1 in [this publication](https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep4.1797#hep41797-tbl-0001) 
for more details)

The focus is on the following gene families:

* Phase I Metabolism
  + Cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenase (CYP)
  + Flavin dependent monooxygenases (FMO)
  + Monoamine oxidase (MAO)
  + Cyclooxgenase (COX)
  + Dihydrodioldehydrogenase (DH)
  + DT-Diaphorase (NQOR)
  + Alcohol- and Aldehyddehydrogenase (ADH/ALDH)
  + Epoxidhydrolase (EPH)
* Phase II Metabolism
  + Glutathiontransferase (GST)
  + UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)
  + Sulfotransferase (SULT)
  + Acetyltransferase (NAT)
  + Methyltransferase (MT)
* Carrier
  + Blood side
  + Canalicular side
