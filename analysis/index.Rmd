# About
In this project I analyze the expression of genes involved in the metabolism of 
xenobiotic substances in a mouse model that develops chronic liver disease 
induced by administration of CCl~4~ for 2, 6 and 12 months [@Holland2021]. In 
addition I compare their expression in mouse against the expression in patients 
that suffer from chronic liver disease utilizing a set of publicly patient 
cohorts with transcriptomic data (see Table 1 in [@Holland2021] for more 
details)

The focus is on the following gene families:

* Phase I Metablism
  + Cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenase (CYP)
  + Flavin dependent monooxygenases (FMO)
  + Monoamine oxidase (MAO)
  + Cyclooxgenase (COX)
  + Dihydrodioldehydrogenase (DH)
  + DT-Diaphorase (NQOR)
  + Alcohol- and Aldehyddehydrogenase (ADH/ALDH)
  + Epoxidhydrolase (EPH)
* Phase II Metabolism
  + Glutathiontransferase (GST)
  + UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)
  + Sulfotransferase (SULT)
  + Acetyltransferase (NAT)
  + Methyltransferase (MT)
* Carrier
  + Blood side
  + Canalicular side
